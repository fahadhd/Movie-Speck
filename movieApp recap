How to make a movieAPP

Include a fragment on startup
In fragments xml set it up as a framelayout with a gridview

Depending on if its a phone or table do some logic with the width
to figure out how many items should appear on screen. This is done in both the main and fragment classes.

In fragment class
Create a backround task that extends async
A. Connects to api and parses the data (done in doInBackground task)
B. Stores that data into the custome adapter view (done in OnPostExecute)
(This is all called with taskyoucreated.exectute())

Create a custome adapter called imageadapter that
A. Returns the imageview of each indivdual poster in the arraylist
passed in from onPostExectute

Create a Settings class and implement settings for the user by
A. Create a new activity called settings activity
B. Create a xml directory and in it will be pref.xml 
C. You can do some stuff to the xml and add files to the values directory such as an array to map options to labels used by pref.xml
D. Write the code that implements all of this (Look this up on youtube)
Basicaled sharedpreferences does all the work for you and when the user selects an item in the array (aka their preference in the list) all you have to do is find out which preferences is the currented preferences via sharedpreferences = preferencemanager.getactivity blah 
and then find its string ...sharedpref.getString blah blah and then compare it to the preference getString(R.string.blah)

Create another fragment that is the child of the main activity. This will show the movies details when clicked.
